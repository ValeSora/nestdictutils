# A list of strings that are module names of extensions:
# - 'sphinx.ext.autodoc' is needed to automatically generate
#   documentation from source code files, and it is installed
#   together with Sphinx.
# - 'numpydoc' is needed to parse NumPy-style docstrings, and it
#   needs to be installed separately (it can be done with
#   'pip install numpydoc').
# - 'myst_parser' is needed to parse Markwodn files, and it needs
#   to be installed separately (it can be done with 'pip install
#   myst-parser').

# with this suffix as sources. The value can be a dictionary mapping
# file extensions to file types.

# A list of paths that contain custom static files (such as style
# sheets or script files). Relative paths are taken as relative to

# _static directory after the theme’s static files, so a file
# named default.css will overwrite the theme’s default.css.
